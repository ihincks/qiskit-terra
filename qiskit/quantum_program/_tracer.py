"""Writing a quantum program as ordinary Python arithmetic.

Declaring an input returns a :class:`Tracer`, and every operation on a tracer returns another one.
An operation builds a Python expression, so no program exists while one is being written. Each
operation asks Rust for the types it produces from the types it is given, which is what reports a
dtype or shape mistake at the line that made it and makes every intermediate's type available at
once.

:func:`build` turns the expressions reachable from the declared outputs into a program. It walks
them memoised by identity, so a value used twice becomes one node and a value that reaches no
output is never built.
