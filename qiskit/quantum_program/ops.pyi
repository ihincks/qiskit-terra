# The classes here are declared by hand because they come from the compiled extension module,
# which has no signatures of its own. Each member's summary line is repeated so that a hover
# keeps showing one; the full documentation lives on the Rust type. Nothing may be declared here
# that the class does not have, which test_quantum_program.py checks. A class declares only its own
# members and inherits the rest, and every type it names is imported absolutely, so that the test
# reads no import here as an export.
