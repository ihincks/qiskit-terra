.. currentmodule:: qiskit.quantum_program

A quantum program describes a quantum-centric computation. The heart of such a computation is a
shot loop, which can optionally be prefixed or suffixed with classical operations that prepare
input parameter values for the circuits in the shot loop, or post-process samples collected
from running the shot loop. A quantum program is itself an inert structure: it describes a
computation without performing one.

All data processing inside of a quantum program is tensor based. A quantum program is a data flow
of tensors. Quantum work is therefore structured as an operation that maps tensors of parameter
value data to bit-valued arrays of output data via quantum circuits. Examples of pre-processing
include tasks like randomizing circuit paramaters. Examples of post-processing include tasks like
computing expectation values or performing post-selection. Quantum programs do not contain
control flow; they are not intended to be used to orchestrate closed loop experiments like VQE.
Instead, they aim to capture the semantics of out-of-coherence operations that have the potential
to reduce the amount of data traveling to and from the Quantum Computer by formatting it in the
precise way that an experiment requires.

A program's inputs and outputs are expressed as a data tree with tensor-valued leaves. The
tree structure is user specified.

Writing a program
=================

A :func:`shot_loop` creates a node that is the core quantum execution unit. It holds a list of
quantum circuits and a shot count, and represents a directive to sample classical register
values from each circuit for that number of shots::

    from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit.quantum_program import build, shot_loop

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(5)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.measure_all()

    outcomes = shot_loop([circuit], shots=1024)
    outcomes[0]["meas"].type      # TensorType(Bit[1024, 5])

A shot loop produces one value per classical register of each circuit, addressed by circuit and
register name. Each is a :class:`Tracer`, which stands for a value the program will produce rather
than one in hand. The arithmetic operators, the bitwise operators and the reductions all build
another tracer, so post-processing is written as ordinary arithmetic, and each operation reports the
type it produces as it is written, so a dtype or shape mistake is raised at the line that made it::

    excited = outcomes[0]["meas"].mean(axis=0)
    excited.type                  # TensorType(F64[5])

A tracer records an expression and nothing else. :func:`build` names the outputs, with whatever
nesting they should come back in, and gives the program::

    program = build({"excited": excited, "samples": outcomes})
    program.output_types()
    # DataTree([excited: TensorType(F64[5]), samples: [[meas: TensorType(Bit[1024, 5])]]])

Only the expressions the declared outputs reach are built, so a value used twice becomes one node
and a value nothing uses costs nothing.

Circuit parameters
==================

When a circuit is parametric, it requires a tensor input whose last axis matches the number of
parameters, in the order :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.parameters` gives them, and whose leading axes
result in a sweep over parameter value sets. In this case, the output tensor for some classical
register of the circuit has shape ``(*leading_axes, shots, creg_size)``, i.e. the same number of
shots are collected for every parametric configuration of the circuit::

    from qiskit.circuit import Parameter, QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit.quantum_program import f64, qp_input, shot_loop

    circuit1 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    circuit1.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

    circuit2 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    circuit2.rx(Parameter("phi"), 0)
    circuit2.rx(Parameter("theta"), 1)
    circuit2.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

    angles = qp_input("angles", f64[16, 2])
    outcomes = shot_loop([circuit1, circuit2], shots=1024, parameter_values=[None, angles])
    outcomes[1]["c"].type         # TensorType(Bit[16, 1024, 2])

In the above, supplying ``None`` as the parameter value array is equivalent to supplying an empty
constant array.

:func:`qp_input` declares a typed input, supplied when the program is called, so ``angles`` is
whatever the caller passes. The program input ``angles`` could also be replaced, for example, by a
constant array ``np.linspace(0, 1, 32).reshape(16, 2)``.

Running a program
=================

Circuits are sampled by a backend, so a program holding a shot loop cannot run in process,
without a QPU or simulator present. However, a program of only classical operations can be run
directly without any external tools, which may be helpful for setting up and debugging portions
of a program. To do this, provide a keyword argument per declared input::

    x = qp_input("x", f64[3])
    program = build({"z": (x * x).mean(axis=0)})
    program(x=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0])    # DataTree([z: array(4.66666667)])

Looking at a program
====================

A program, or partially constructed program, can be visualized either as a code listing::

    print(program.listing())

which gives::

    @0: // entry point
      %0: F64[3] = qiskit.parameter x
      %1: F64[3] = qiskit.multiply(%0, %0)
      %2: F64[] = qiskit.mean[axis=0](%1)
      results:
        z = %2

Or as a data-flow directed acyclic graph, where every edge represents a tensor, and every node
a tensor operation, ``program.draw()``, which needs the optional Graphviz and Pillow packages. The
:func:`listing` and :func:`draw` functions do the same for one :class:`Tracer`.

Dtypes
======

A dtype is a member of :class:`DType`. Each has a lower-case alias, and indexing one
with a shape gives the :class:`TensorType` of a value::

    f64[3]                        # a vector of three 64-bit floats
    bit[4000, 2]                  # a 4000x2 array of bits
    f64[()]                       # a scalar
    bit[1024, bounded(64)]        # an axis whose size is known only at run time

The current aliases are ``bit``, ``u8``, ``u16``, ``u32``, ``u64``, ``i8``, ``i16``, ``i32``,
``i64``, ``f32``, ``f64``, ``c64`` and ``c128``.
