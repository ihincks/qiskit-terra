.. currentmodule:: qiskit.quantum_program

A quantum program describes a hybrid quantum-classical computation as typed tensor values
produced and consumed by nodes. It is inert data: it describes a computation without
performing one.

A program's inputs and outputs travel in a data tree, arranged by the structures the program
declares, which is where all naming lives.
