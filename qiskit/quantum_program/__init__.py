.. currentmodule:: qiskit.quantum_program

A quantum program describes a hybrid quantum-classical computation as typed tensor values
produced and consumed by nodes. It is inert data: it describes a computation without
performing one.

A program's inputs and outputs travel in a data tree, arranged by the structures the program
declares, which is where all naming lives.

Writing a program
=================

:func:`qp_input` declares a typed input and returns a :class:`Tracer`, which the arithmetic
operators, the bitwise operators and the reductions build on. Each operation reports the type it
produces as it is written, so a dtype or shape mistake is raised at the line that made it::

    from qiskit.quantum_program import build, f64, qp_input

    x = qp_input("x", f64[3])
    y = (x * x).mean(axis=0)
    y.type                        # TensorType(F64[])

:func:`build` names the outputs, with whatever nesting they should come back in, and gives the
program. Calling it takes one keyword argument per declared input::

    program = build({"z": y})
    program.output_types()        # DataTree([z: TensorType(F64[])])
    program(x=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0])    # DataTree([z: array(4.66666667)])

Only the expressions the declared outputs reach are built, so a value used twice becomes one node
and a value nothing uses costs nothing.

Dtypes
======

A dtype is a member of :class:`DType`. Each has a lower-case alias, and indexing one
with a shape gives the :class:`TensorType` of a value::

    f64[3]                        # a vector of three 64-bit floats
    bit[4000, 2]                  # a 4000x2 array of bits
    f64[()]                       # a scalar
    bit[1024, bounded(64)]        # an axis whose size is known only at run time

The current aliases are ``bit``, ``u8``, ``u16``, ``u32``, ``u64``, ``i8``, ``i16``, ``i32``,
``i64``, ``f32``, ``f64``, ``c64`` and ``c128``.
